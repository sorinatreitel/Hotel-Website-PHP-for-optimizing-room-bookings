# https---github.com-sorinatreitel-Hotel-Website-PHP-for-optimizing-room-bookings
The project involves a hotel seeking to expand its online presence and attract more customers through the creation of a website. The website will facilitate the booking process, requiring users to log in. Visitors can explore the available facilities, room features, and other pertinent information about the hotel.After a reservation is made, the client will receive an email confirming the booking.Users have the option to provide a review for the hotel room.
This application is built on several key technologies: the PHP programming language, utilizing the Laravel framework; a MariaDB database; and the Stripe payment API for processing payments. On the front-end, I employed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
The administrator's role encompasses room management, reservation oversight, facility management, handling special periods, generating PDFs for reservations, and managing database operations.
I'm proud to declare that this project represents the culmination of my dedicated academic journey, presented as my bachelor's thesis.
